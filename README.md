# julia-ACIO-model
This repo is for learning to use the Julia programming language and creating an activity-by-commodity input-output model. I work with input-output models at my job, and I am interested in using the Julia programming language for builiding I-O models, linear programming, and econometric analysis.

I am currently using Debian GNU/Linux 12 on Chrome OS Version 137.0.7151.137. The Julia version is 1.11.6.
